So I recently added RSS feeds to my blog and that means I would have to edit 3 files to create a blog post. That's ridiculous! So I made a new blog site in PHP. All of the data comes in from the RSS feed, meaning I only have to edit 1 file. In the future, I will probably create a program which automatically formats the XML and stuff so I only need to worry about typing the article. I considered automatically generating a summary using AI but it didn't work out so well. In the future when AI improves, I might do that. The site is hosted on domino server (one of my 2 servers) using Apache in a docker container and is then proxied through Caddy which generates the SSL certificate. As of right now Caddy is running on a raspberry pi so if the site grows in popularity I might have to scale things up. There are still a couple things I need to add to the website but for now it is in great shape!  
  
So that is it about my new site. I do have some more exciting news! I am gonna resume posting on the Sid Talks Linux channel as well as the FOSS Rant podcast. I have been really busy in the past few months with school and other stuff.
