I have just made yet another website! This one is inspired by [codenoid/github-roast](https://github-roast.pages.dev/). Basically you just input a link to your portfolio site and it roasts it. Once you roast it, make sure to post it to Mastodon and Twitter with the [#devportfolioroast](https://mastodon.social/tags/devportfolioroast) hashtag.  
The front-end was written in HTML, CSS, and JS and the backend fully in Python. Once you input the URL, the backend will send a request to the Gemma:2B model from Google using Ollama. It will then send the roast back to the browser and display it. The site is super simple.  
Now it is time for you to go and roast your portfolio: [https://portfolio-roast.thefossrant.com](https://portfolio-roast.thefossrant.com/)
