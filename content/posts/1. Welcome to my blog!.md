I now have a blog where I can post stuff to. All of these blog posts will be sent to mastodon if you would like to receive notifications when I make a post. My page is @sidgames5@mastodon.social.  
  
I wrote this blog page entirely with HTML and CSS meaning you can disable JavaScript and still be able to read my posts. That does make it slightly more inconvenient for me to make posts, but you won't have to use JavaScript and the page will load a bit faster. Unfortunately there is no RSS feed yet.  
  
I will make posts here whenever I do something interesting. I will also post my video tutorials here in text form for those of you who like to read.
