New year (almost), new ~~me~~ blog! It feels like this is the millionth time I made a new blog. My previous blog was really bad. I had to write blog posts inside a JSON file. Nothing at all was automated.

Recently I started using Obsidian to take notes. It's just a markdown editor but with a fancy UI and some more features. Then one day I realized I could write my blog posts in Obsidian and have them automatically pushed to my website.

## Pipeline
I need everything to be fully automated. I should be able to write a blog post in Obsidian and then a few minutes later it should appear on the website.

Here is how things work:
1. I write a blog post in obsidian
2. Hugo builds a static site
3. Static site gets uploaded to GitHub
4. GitHub pages deploys the site

## Deployment
Initially, I was going to make my own backend that converts the markdown files to HTML files. That was until I found Hugo. Hugo does the exact thing I want and it also has a large selection of themes and it is really easy to deploy.

The nice thing about Hugo is that it builds a 100% static site. You can use the `hugo server` command to deploy it but you do have the option of using a web server of your choice.

### Using GitHub Pages for deployment
At first, I was going to deploy the static site using a web server in my homelab. But then I realized I can just use GitHub pages to deploy it.

This was really simple. I just needed to deploy it using Pages and change the DNS entry in cloudflare.

## Troubleshooting
I finished deploying it through GitHub Pages and I did everything I need but the website says there are no blog posts! This is odd as when running `hugo server` everything works. I even ran a custom web server on the `public` directory and that worked! This is really strange.

Then I realized my mistake. I forgot to commit the main branch to GitHub. The repository has 2 branches: the main branch, and the static branch. GitHub Pages will deploy from the static branch. I used a git command to send the public folder to the static branch and apparently I needed to commit on the main branch first.

Now everything works just fine!

## Automating the writing process
The last challenge in building this blog is automatically getting my notes from Obsidian to GitHub. During testing, I used the `rsync` command to copy all of the blog posts from my notes folder to the Hugo folder. Then I would run the `hugo` command to build the site. I made a shell script that will do this for me automatically.

Now I need to figure out how to automatically run this shell script when I write a new blog post. I can just run the script every time but then I won't be able to write posts on my laptop. I made a script using `inotifywait` to scan for file changes and run the script. However now I have encountered a problem. Git requires me to enter the password for my GPG key every time I want to commit something, including these blog posts. That means a popup will appear asking for my password every time I want to write a blog post. This was simple to bypass by disabling GPG signing for the commit.

## Conclusion
Now that the new blog is done, hopefully I will be motivated to write more blog posts due to the ease of use. I have 2-way sync through Nextcloud on my desktop and laptop so in theory I will be able to write blog posts on my laptop just like I do on my desktop. See you all next year!
