This morning I woke up to my phone using mobile data and my home assistant automations not working. Initially I thought it the power was out, but I could turn on the lights just fine. I checked my UniFi app and saw that the server was not connected to the network at all. This meant that the cable got unplugged, the switch isn't working, or the server isn't working. It said the switch was connected and another device was connected to the switch so that narrows it down to just 2 cases. So I opened my server closet in the basement and immediately noticed something was wrong. I couldn't figure out what was wrong but I just felt like something was wrong. Everything was plugged in, the network switch lights were blinking like normal, my raspberry pi was running just fine, even the server indicator lights were on. My main server is an old gaming PC so it has a glass side panel so I looked inside and I could see the fan spinning, but I could not hear it. Usually I have it set to full speed and I can hear full speed very well. I tried rebooting the server with the power button and the fans didn't go to full speed. As a last resort, I brought down a keyboard and monitor. As soon as I plugged in the monitor, I saw that there was a prompt to set the time on the BIOS!

In my opinion, this was the stupidest reason for an outage.  
  

## Further investigations

I dug a little deeper and discovered that the BIOS had been reset during a power outage right before all of this happened. So far I have consulted the motherboard manual and found absolutely nothing about this. After a bit of research, I think it could have been that the [CMOS battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvolatile_BIOS_memory) has died. This is a really simple fix but I don't have the replacement battery right now. This means that I will have the same exact issue after the next power outage unless I replace the battery.  
  

## Preventing this in the future

From what I can see, I just need to replace the CMOS battery. But this computer has been running for over 4 years, so what is stopping this from happening again around 2028? The most effective solution is going to be preventing power outages in the first place. This can be done using a battery backup or a standby generator. Standby generators will last longer during a power outage but are typically more expensive and harder to setup than a simple battery backup.
