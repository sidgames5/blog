A few months ago I purchased a UniFi Dream Router after experiencing problems with my ISP-provided router. And now I can't go back. I have tried 2 different ISP routers as well as a couple "gaming" routers. The difference between your router and the UniFi Dream Router is that UniFi makes enterprise hardware. They managed to pack all of the enterprise features from their super expensive rackmount hardware into a small $200 device. You might be wondering what the difference is between a residential and enterprise router. The main thing is reliability. With the dream router, I have had zero down time not related to power outages.  
  
The Dream Router also has the advantage of the UniFi ecosystem. By using one of the PoE ports on the Dream Router, I was able to add a UniFi Flex Mini which gives me 4 more ethernet ports without any power cables.  
  
The dream router also provides an affordable introduction to the UniFi ecosystem for small businesses. If you don't have much money and you need quality internet, you can use the Dream Router and simply replace it for something like the Dream Machine Pro for more capacity.  
  
I highly recommend the Dream Router for people seeking a reliable and expandable network. This is not at all sponsored, this is just from my experience. Unfortunately it has been out of stock on the UniFi website for a while but you can get it for about $300 on Amazon.
