      <description>&lt;p&gt;For almost a year I have been using Pi-hole as the only DNS server in my network. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Pi-hole is an open-source solution for custom DNS records and ad-blocking in your home network. My Pi-hole instance has worked just fine up until now. Recently, it has started slowing down the entire network and crashing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;picking-a-server&#34;&gt;Picking a server&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now I have 3 servers. 2 of them are running linux, and the other one is running Home Assistant OS. The Home Assistant server is pretty locked down so it may be hard to get Pi-hole up and running on it. One of the linux servers is already running Pi-hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
