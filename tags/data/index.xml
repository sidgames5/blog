      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly Monday morning. School was cancelled due to the ice on the roads. I thought it would be a perfect day to get some stuff done in my homelab. But as they say, anything that can go wrong will go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-signs&#34;&gt;First signs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the morning I installed Pi-hole on my raspberry pi. You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.thefossrant.com/posts/10.-setting-up-a-second-pi-hole/&#34;&gt;my blog post&lt;/a&gt; about that. After I deployed the Pi-hole, I tried to install another app to deploy something else. When I was installing that, I was getting errors about some syntax error in a file. I opened the file in question using vim and it looked normal. I found a backup of that file and I copied the backup to the main file and everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
