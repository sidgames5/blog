      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I recently added RSS feeds to my blog and that means I would have to edit 3 files to create a blog post. That&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous! So I made a new blog site in PHP. All of the data comes in from the RSS feed, meaning I only have to edit 1 file. In the future, I will probably create a program which automatically formats the XML and stuff so I only need to worry about typing the article. I considered automatically generating a summary using AI but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well. In the future when AI improves, I might do that. The site is hosted on domino server (one of my 2 servers) using Apache in a docker container and is then proxied through Caddy which generates the SSL certificate. As of right now Caddy is running on a raspberry pi so if the site grows in popularity I might have to scale things up. There are still a couple things I need to add to the website but for now it is in great shape!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
